It just requires thinking outside of the box, or rather in something similar. No matter what size area is available, all you need to know is how to start an urban garden.

                                    Simply put, Planting by the Moon (also called Gardening by the Moon or Moon Phase Gardening) is the idea that the lunar cycle affects plant growth. Just as the Moon’s gravitational pull creates the tides of the oceans, it also creates more moisture in the soil, which encourages growth.

                                <p>
                                    While most of the time snails are a friendly (dare I even say cute) creature, sometimes they can be too much for gardeners. Cabbage-loving pests, snails can do quite a bit of damage if they have great enough numbers. But most of the time, they’re simply just part of the garden’s ecosystem.

                                    It seems odd to think of plants as hearing anything, but research shows that they may well be able to respond to sounds.
