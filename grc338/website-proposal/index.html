					<h1> About </h1>
				
					<p>We are a small, locally owned business that opened up shop in the sunny town on San Luis Obispo in April of 2020, shortly after graduating at the neighboring college of Cal Poly. Our time spent within the Graphic Communication department at Cal Poly cultivated a love for old-fashioned printing and tanigible product creation. Our love for connecting with our friends and family in meaningul ways have led us to creating the Outpost, a way for individuals to write meaningful messages that are tailored for the reciever. </p>
